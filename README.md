# CRYPTO DIARY
âš This is a work in progress project!âš 

## What is this project about?
I often lose track of any token I buy on the coin market.
I forgot the price and conditions on which I bougth a token.
This app should help me to not lose track of any token anymore and make it easy to know if I bought on good conditions or not.
Maybe I will make better decisions in future with crypto with this app, before I sell ;) - PAPERHAND vs ðŸ’Žâœ‹!! -

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ TO THE MOON! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## What will be used for this app?
- React.Native
- Expo Debugger

## What features will come?
- Automatic scan for token on several chains (firstly BSCChain)
- Add list for scanned tokens
- Add "diary" functions for each coin (Add price on date, add amount on date)
- Add summary functions
